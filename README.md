# Geometric-Deep-Learning
This repository contains my exam for the Geometric Deep Learning course at the University of Oxford, delivered in Hilary 2023. The exam asked to conduct a study (experimental or theoretical) of a phenomenon of choice. I chose to analyze the zero one laws of graph neural networks, inspired by this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13060
